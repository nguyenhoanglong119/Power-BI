BUSINESS & MARKETING ANALYTICS REPORTS

Overview
This repository contains interactive Power BI reports designed to provide a comprehensive overview of business operations and marketing performance. The project involved building a robust Concept Dimension System to establish a solid data foundation, along with detailed Business Analysis and Marketing Analysis Reports, all aimed at supporting data-driven strategic decision-making.

Project Goal
The primary objective of this project was to develop a suite of analytical reports, encompassing:

**Concept Dimension System**  : To establish a clear and consistent data model for various business dimensions.
**Business Analysis Report**  : To monitor key business performance indicators such as revenue, profit, and sales volume.
**Marketing Analysis Report** : To track marketing performance metrics, including traffic, marketing costs, and their impact on sales.

Data Source
The entire analysis was performed using clean, structured data directly sourced from Excel files.

Key Insights
Based on the analysis presented in these reports, the following general insights were derived:

Diversified Revenue Streams: The business successfully generates revenue across various marketing channels (Google Ads, SEO, Facebook Ads, Organic), indicating a healthy and diversified customer acquisition strategy.
Product Performance Dominance: The Phone product line consistently emerges as a primary driver of both online traffic and overall revenue, highlighting its central role in the business's portfolio. Individually, "Asus ROG Strix" stands out as the top-performing product by revenue.

Balanced Customer Demographics: The customer base exhibits a near 50/50 split between male and female, suggesting broad market appeal and effective targeting across genders.
Furthermore, leveraging statistical observations, deeper insights include:

Traffic Volatility vs Revenue Stability: While overall revenue shows a relatively stable growth trend from 2020-2023, marketing traffic exhibits greater fluctuations. This suggests that marketing campaigns might experience more seasonality or varying effectiveness, which could be statistically modeled for improved forecasting and resource allocation.

Cost-Effectiveness Optimization Opportunities: Although the Phone product line dominates in traffic and revenue, a deeper statistical analysis of marketing spend per product line (e.g., comparing Marketing Cost to Traffic or Revenue generated) could reveal opportunities to optimize ROI. For instance, smaller product lines might yield a higher return on marketing investment relative to their traffic or sales contribution.
